        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div id="algo-steps">
            <h3>Prepare the points</h3>
            <div class="tab-out">
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Find a corner point</h3>
                    <p>
                        Find the point with the lowest x and y coordinate.
                        Since the y axis is inverted when drawing, this means finding
                        the top leftmost point.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Sort points by angle</h3>
                    <p>
                        Create a list of the points by angle in counter-clockwise order.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Remove points with shared angles</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since we want to encapsulate all points, we want to prioritize 
                        points that are further out (and ignore closer ones).
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Check if there are enough points</h3>
                    <p>
                        If there are exactly 2 other points left, we have a triangle.
                        If there are less, there is no shape.
                        Otherwise, we proceed through the rest of the points.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Traversing through points</h3>
            <div class="tab-out">
                <div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>Add three points to a 'stack'</h3>
                        <p>
                            Take the first three points from our sorted list and add them to a 'stack'.
                            Use a pseudo-stack since we always want to look at the top three points,
                            and only ever have to remove the second newest point.
                            This stack will eventually form our convex hull.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>Determine the angle between the points</h3>
                        <p>
                            Find the angle from the last added point to the second last, and from the second last
                            added point to the third last. We can find the difference between the angles, and determine if 
                            it is clockwise (concave) or counterclockwise.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>Remove concave points</h3>
                        <p>
                            If the angle between the last added three points was clockwise, we would have a concave angle,
                            meaning the second last added point must be removed from the stack. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Repeat for points in order</h3>
                        <p>
                            Repeat the point addition, angle check, and concave removal for all points in our list
                            or sorted points.
                        </p>
